<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>Beginner Track (Intro to Financial Applications in Python):
Learn basic programming concepts in Python, including  input/output, variables, functions, loops, datatypes, and file operations.
Practice loading, processing, and analyzing CSV formatted (i.e. tabular) data.
Fetch real-time financial data from the Internet, using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
Advanced Track (Financial Modeling in Python):
Discuss predictive modeling and machine learning problem formulation.

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>With increased ease of access to real-time financial data, quantitative techniques for processing this data have become mainstream in the financial industry. This course focuses on introducing students to fundamental data analysis techniques, using the Python programming language. After completing this course, students should achieve a working knowledge of Python, and gain confidence in using Python to solve quantitative problems in finance and business....</p>
<h2>Require Study Materials</h2>
<p>There are no required texts, but students are encouraged to consult online Python programming resources such as:
Python Documentation
Python Tutorial
Python Functions
Python Constants
PEP 8 Style Guide
W3Schools Python Tutorial
Prof Rossetti's Intro to Python

Students may also find it helpful to reference documentation for specific Python packages, as needed:
Data Processing and Analysis:
Pandas Package Docs
Numpy Package Docs
Data Visualization:
Matplotlib Package Docs
Seaborn Package Docs
Plotly Package Docs (recommended)
Data Science:
Scipy Package Docs
Predictive Modeling:
Statsmodels Package Docs
Sklearn Package Docs
Software (Python Notebooks)
Python notebook (.IPYNB) documents will be used for all exercises and deliverables. Students are encouraged to use Google Colab (see below) to run notebooks in the cloud, as this option requires no additional software installations! 

Python notebook documents contain "code cells" and "text cells". In the code cells we write Python. In the text cells we can write in Markdown (see this Markdown Cheat Sheet for more details).
Colab Notebooks
Google Colab enables the remote development and execution of Python notebooks in the cloud, instead of on a local computer. 

All students should have access to Colab through their university-issued Google accounts. Students should take time before the first class to confirm they are able to visit the Colab website, access their own "Welcome to Colaboratory" notebook, and watch the included Introduction to Colab video (just the first two minutes), and review the Overview of Colab Features notebook (just the "Cells" part).</p>
