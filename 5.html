While I use the latest edition of the text, it is not much different from earlier editions, which
you are free to use at your own risk. However, page numbers and problem numbers are
different in the earlier editions. Note that renting the eBook is much more affordable than the
hard cover book.

Current Issues of The Wall Street Journal, and business magazines such as Forbes or Business
Week. As business practitioners, you should read The Wall Street Journal daily. Since the U.S.
financial press tends to be rather provincial, you should also regularly read a business publication
that is not published in the U.S., such as the Financial Times or the Economist. You can get the
super cheap student subscription price to the Wall Street Journal (either hard copy or digital or
both) at the following link: www.wsj.com/studentoffer
Don’t forget to enter “Georgetown University” under school and “Angel, Jim” under professor.
FINRA Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Examination
If you are going to become a financial professional, it is likely that sooner or later you will be
required to register with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and take a number
of examinations such as the Series 7 exam. The first step is the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE)
Examination, which is a prerequisite for the other examinations. You do not have to be affiliated
with a FINRA-member firm to sign up for and take the SIE. I recommend that you take the SIE
sooner rather than later as it allows you to signal on your resume that you are serious about finance,
and that you have learned enough to pass the test.
The test consists of 75 multiple choice questions spread over 105 minutes. It costs $60 and is valid
for four years. More information can be found on the FINRA web site at:
http://www.finra.org/industry/essentials-exam
http://www.finra.org/industry/sie-students
You should be fairly well prepared to take the SIE after this class but I still recommend that you
sit down with some study materials and do some practice tests as not all of the material on the SIE
is covered in POI. I do not endorse any particular SIE test prep firms, but the following firms are
offering discounts to Georgetown students:

There is no coursepack for this course. Rather, additional readings will be disseminated via
Canvas.</p>
