You must read at least one of the books from the required reading list (again, based on your client’s location) and be prepared to discuss the book in a session held during the GCP Prep Weekend. Books listed as supplemental are not required, but you may find them helpful and interesting. Book comments are provided by Professor Eberhart.

Johannesburg, required reading (pick one)
A History of South Africa, Leonard Thompson (Revised and Updated by Lynn Berat), 4th Edition, 2014, Yale University Press.
Comments: A tour de force that begins with the history of early man in South Africa, and ends with a discussion of the many challenges the country currently faces. Although it is written in a scholarly style—the author was a distinguished professor at Yale—it is an invaluable overview.

Long Walk to Freedom, Nelson Mandela, 2013 (with updated forward), Little, Brown & Company.
Comments: This is an inspirational and well-written autobiography of the man who endured countless hardships in his fight against the Apartheid regime. He was instrumental in preventing the outbreak of a South African civil war following the collapse of Apartheid, and became the first leader of the post-Apartheid government.

Born a Crime, Trevor Noah, 2016, Spiegel & Grau.
Comments: I knew that this former host of The Daily Show was from South Africa before I read this book, but I had no idea he was such a good writer. So, while I was expecting to read some funny stories—and Noah delivers here—I did not expect to learn so much about South African culture. Noah also shares some deeply personal experiences that make this book a riveting read.

Johannesburg, supplemental reading (optional)
The Covenant, James Michener, 1980, Random House. 
Comments: This is one of many lengthy historical novels that Michener wrote about various countries and regions of the world. As with many of his other novels, Michener covers the entire history of the country to the time of the book’s original publication (1980 in this case). Although it is more than 40 years old, it is an excellent complement to A History of South Africa. 

Welcome to our Hillbrow: A Novel of Postaprartheid South Africa, Phaswane Mpe, 2011, Ohio University Press
Comments: Compelling, insightful, and tragic account of the lives of immigrants from other countries in Africa in one of most dangerous areas of Johannesburg.

Portrait with Keys: The City of Johannesburg Unlocked, Ivan Vladislavic, 2006, W.W. Norton & Company.
Comments: A fascinating, diary-like view of the changes in Johannesburg since apartheid ended from the perspective of a South-African born and raised man of Croatian origin who is a Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Witwatersrand.

Windhoek, required reading (pick one)
A History of Namibia: From the Beginning to 1990, Marion Wallace, 2014, Oxford University Press.
Comments: This is the one book I have not had a chance to read carefully but it is a compendium of Namibian history that I think the students on the projects for firms in Namibia will find helpful to read.

The Last Train to Zona Verde: My Ultimate African Safari, Paul Theroux, 2014, Mariner Books. 
Comments: Theroux is an acclaimed travel writer—and a fearless traveler as the reader learns when Theroux is stuck in a small town in Angola with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay—and he does not disappoint with this book that documents his travels from Cape Town, through Namibia, and into Angola.

Madrid, required reading
A History of Spain, Peter Pierson, 1999, Greenwood Press.

Comments: This book covers the history of Spain from when humans first arrived in the peninsula 40,000 to 1999. At 248 pages, it is a succinct overview, but it is informative and helpful, especially when paired with at least one of the other recommended readings.

Madrid, supplemental reading (optional)
Don Quixote, Miguel De Cervantes, 2003, Penguin Classics
Comments: Do it, just do it. It’s too long but it’s a classic for a reason. Brilliant, funny, and insightful.

The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway, 2016, Scribner
Comments: Hemingway and Spain. Need I say more to motivate you to read this book (or, perhaps more likely, reread it since you may have read it in middle school or high school but I expect you will appreciate more now)?

Iberia, James A. Michener, 2015, Dial Press Trade Paperback
Comments: As with Michener’s book on South Africa, this book covers the entire history of the country to the time of the book’s original publication (1968 in this case). I do not think this book is as good as Michener’s book on South Africa but it is still a worthwhile read filled with unique insights on Spanish culture, geography, politics, wildlife, etc.

London, required reading
A Brief History of London, Jeremy Black, 2022, Robinson Press.
Comments: A very succinct but also very readable history of London. It does the job of providing an overview of London’s development and key events.

London, supplemental reading (optional)
The Diary of Samuel Pepys (available for free at https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/)
Comments: The Dairy of Samuel Pepys is regularly listed among the greatest diaries of all times, and I think you will see why if you read it. Pepys was a Cambridge-educated naval administer and later a member of parliament who decided to record recollections of his daily life on January 1, 1660. Over nearly the next 10 years, he witnessed the Second Dutch-Anglo War (1665-1667), the Great Plague of London (1665-1666), and the Great Fire of London in 1666. Besides providing a fascinating first-person account of these extraordinary events, he also documents his ambitions, worries, and his many scandalous actions and thoughts. It’s a uniquely insightful perspective on life in London in the 17th century.</p>

<h2>Additional Info</h2>
<p>EXTRA GRADING INFO: IMPORTANT: you will receive a letter grade for this course. To determine course letter grades, we will first calculate students’ raw course scores based on the weights above. We will then rank the scores from highest to lowest. Letter grades will be assigned in order of the rankings and in consonance with MSB grading policies.


Travel Documentation
An important aspect of professionalism in a global business environment is planning ahead for travel. To help you develop this skill, as well as to aid in logistical planning, you will be required to provide various pieces of travel information (e.g., passport and visa information, medical release, etc.). As we announced on October 22, 2023, if you provide the necessary documentation on time, you get full credit; zero otherwise. There will be no extensions or exceptions: it is your responsibility to make the appropriate arrangements in advance of the deadlines.

A scanned copy of your passport must be uploaded to the appropriate Box folder (see past email correspondence) by 11:59pm ET on January 19, 2024. The file you submit must follow this naming convention: Last name_First name_Passport_2024 GCP. Failure to follow this naming convention may result in a reduction of points. 

A scanned copy of your visas (if necessary) must be uploaded to the appropriate Box folder (see past email correspondence) by 11:59pm ET on February 2, 2024. The file you submit must follow this naming convention: Last name_First name_Visas_2024 GCP. Failure to follow this naming convention may result in a reduction of points.

A scanned copy of your flight itineraries must be uploaded to the appropriate Box folder by 11:59pm ET on March 9, 2024. Flight itineraries will be uploaded via the travel document survey emailed on March 5, 2024. The file you submit must follow this naming convention: Last name_First name_flight. Failure to follow this naming convention may result in a reduction of points.

A scanned copy of your signed risk acknowledgment and medical release forms must be uploaded to the appropriate Box folder by 11:59pm ET on March 9, 2024. These documents will be provided via the travel document survey emailed on March 5, 2024. The file you submit must follow this naming convention: Last name_First name_release. Failure to follow this naming convention may result in a reduction of points.


Attendance
Your attendance score is based on your satisfactory attendance and participation during MSFLive class, during the GCP Prep Weekend, and during client meetings in-country. You will receive full credit for each event that you satisfactorily attend; zero otherwise.

What counts as “satisfactory” attendance depends on the type of event (e.g., MSFLive vs. GCP Prep Weekend vs. client meetings) and the judgment of your advising faculty. For example, when attending class or meetings via Zoom, students are expected to follow the same MSFLive procedures as with previous core courses: that is, log in at least 10 minutes before the start date with properly function video (with good lighting) and audio. Students are also expected to remain present and engaged for the duration of the meeting (per MSF Academic Expectations and Best Practices). Additionally, during the GCP Prep Weekend all students are expected to be present when meeting with their advising faculty, and engaged during the scheduled work time.

MSFLive Class Schedule
Unlike other courses in the MSF Program, there will be only two MSFLive class offerings per week for each project location, with a number of exceptions noted in the course schedule (at the end of the syllabus). Unless noted otherwise in the course schedule, all MSFLive classes will be held on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 7:50pm – 9:30pm ET. For example: during the third week of the course, students assigned to Johannesburg projects will attend MSFLive only on Wednesday Mar 27 at 6pm ET.

You must attend the MSFLive class for your project location (i.e., if you are assigned to a Madrid project, then you must attend the Madrid MSFLive classes). Failure to attend the correct section will result in you receiving a zero for that class’ attendance score. See MSF Academic Expectations and Best Practices for additional information. 

Unexcused absence from in-person attendance at GCP Prep Weekend and the Global Residency
All students are expected to attend—for the full duration—the GCP Prep Weekend and to travel for the global residency unless they have an excused absence approved by the MSF program office. Unexcused absence from the on-campus GCP prep weekend will result in an automatic deduction of 10 percentage points from the final grade. Unexcused absence from the in-country global residency will result in an automatic deduction of 20 percentage points from the final grade. Note that unexcused absences also reflect poor judgment and will negatively impact the Judgment Score.
 

Peer Evaluations
You will complete two evaluations of your teammates: one at the mid-point of the course, and the other at the end of the project following the final client presentation. These peer evaluations are anonymous: only the faculty will see how you rated the contributions of your peers. In addition to giving you the experience of assessing the work of your peers, the evaluation will provide the faculty with additional information and context as they make their own evaluations of student engagement and judgement. 

The peer evaluations will be administered via Canvas. Your peer evaluation score will be the average of the scores given to you by your teammates. Failure to submit an evaluation of your peers will result in an automatic zero for your peer evaluation score.


Judgment Score
The course faculty will evaluate each student’s performance in the course based on the student’s quantity and quality of contributions to the project. Important considerations will include, but are not limited to:
Adherence to instructions and responsiveness to faculty requests and directions.
Quality of engagement and communication with peers, faculty and clients.
Attendance at MSLive, faculty consultations, client meetings, and presentations.
Student feedback from peer evaluations.
Quality and professionalism of project management from start to finish, (e.g., taking initiative, being proactive in planning, assigning and completing tasks, communicating with faculty or clients when deadlines may need to be shifted, etc.).
Quality of preparation and effort during the GCP prep weekend (e.g., coming prepared to work and incorporating feedback into the project). 
Appropriate and professional conduct in country at all times, including at client meetings and during cultural activities. 


Team Client Deliverable(s)
You will complete the deliverables required by your client and advising faculty member. Final client deliverable(s) must be uploaded to Canvas prior to the client presentation. Note that your advising professor may have additional instructions (e.g., emailing your presentation to them), depending on their needs or those of the client. Failure to follow these instructions may negatively affect your grade.




Your faculty advisor will assess the quality of your final deliverables and presentation to your client using a rubric, which will be posted on Canvas. Important considerations will include:
Correct use of relevant models, frameworks and theories driven by a clearly articulated business issue and project scope. Correct arithmetic and computations.  
Findings that logically and transparently derive from the evidence and the analysis.
Recommendations that are insightful, important, and are logically derived from the findings.
Overall quality of oral presentation (professional, rehearsed and prepared, clear and to the point, free of superfluous background information).
Overall professionalism and quality of presentation materials and other client deliverables (professional, simple, persuasive, mostly graphical PowerPoint slides, and immediately communicative).

Students will generally receive the same score for the team client deliverable as all team members are expected to contribute equally to the project. However, if a student is judged by the advising professor or client to have contributed significantly more(less) to the project, then they may receive a score that is higher(lower) than that of their teammates. 


Other Requirements
In addition to the items and grading expectations noted above, you should also be aware of the additional expectations and requirements. 

Executive Overview
During the global residency, each team will provide a brief (3-5 minute) overview of their project for their classmates, professors, and administrators. One summary slide per team is permitted.

Non-Disclosure Agreements
Some of the clients may require you to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) as an individual. Although you are Georgetown students, you will not be working on these projects on behalf of Georgetown. So, no one from Georgetown University will be able to sign the NDA on behalf of the university. If needed, there is a template NDA available for download and use on the course site, though many clients may require that you sign their specific NDA.
