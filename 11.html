<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>1a. Attendance and Contribution—Judgment (15%)
For each unit, you are expected to attend and contribute to your regular/assigned MSF Live
session. Performance is evaluated on the basis of the frequency and significance of your
contributions and the professionalism of your comportment. Following are some criteria of
exemplary performance:
‒ Demonstrating familiarity with the course materials;
‒ Staying attentive and avoiding distracting activity;
‒ Offering original and thoughtful ideas and perspectives;
‒ Making connections with ideas from other classes or something in the news;
‒ Sharing relevant work experiences; and
‒ Posing good questions.
Following are some criteria of substandard performance:
‒ Inappropriate/distracting use of the chat function;
‒ Re-stating something that has already been said;
‒ Persisting in consuming time on insignificant or irrelevant matters; and
‒ Failing to demonstrate respect, professionalism, and civility.
The above factors are considered in arriving at a Faculty Judgment score for each unit. The
grading methodology for each unit is as follows:
Points
1 Presented results of a breakout session
1 Provided or tried to provide a contribution
1 Provided or tried to provide a second contribution
1 Provided or tried to provide a third contribution
Points may be adjusted up or down based on the above criteria of exemplary and substandard
performance. Four (4) is the maximum points for any one MSFLive session. The sum of the
points for all six units is used to determine the score for this requirement. That determination
is made by assuming that everyone starts at a “B” and goes up or down based on performance.
1b. Attendance and Contribution—Automatic (10%)
Your MSFLive Attendance Score for each unit is a simple average of the five
components listed below. Your score for the course is a simple average of your average
scores for the six units.

3

1. Did you attend your regular/assigned session? If so, then you receive 100% for this
component, zero otherwise. Note: If you cannot attend your regular session in a
particular week then you must submit the Google Form located on the Canvas
MSFLive page by Tuesday, 11:59PM ET.
2. Did you log in by 3:20PM, 5:50PM or 7:50PM for MSFLive class sessions? If so,
then you receive 100% for this component, zero otherwise.
3. Were you engaged with your audio connection throughout the session? If so, then you
receive 100% for this component, zero otherwise.
4. Were you engaged with your video connection throughout the session? If so, then you
receive 100% for this component, zero otherwise.
5. The percentage of poll questions (if any) that you answered. Note that you are not judged
on whether your poll question answers were correct, just that you answered the questions.
2. Contributions to Discussion Boards—Individual (25%)
You will be pre-assigned to a small group for purposes of this course requirement. You will
be asked to post a response to a prompt before you can see your classmates’ posts. You are
encouraged to engage with your classmates as their responses appear.
Your performance will be evaluated on the basis of the timeliness and thoughtfulness of your
posts. The grading methodology for each unit is as follows:
Points Description of post
0 Failed to make a timely post
1 Superficial
2 Thoughtful
3 Especially insightful
A maximum of three points can be earned per discussion board. The sum of the points for all
of the boards is expressed as a percentage of the total points possible. Then, that percentage is
converted into a score for this requirement.
Discussion Board posts are due by 7:00PM EST on the day before you are scheduled to
attend MSFLive sessions. To illustrate:
‒ If you are scheduled to attend MSFLive on Wednesdays then your posts are due by
7:00PM EST on the preceding Tuesday.
‒ If you are scheduled to attend MSFLive on Thursday then your posts are due by 7:00PM
EST on the preceding Wednesday.

3. Principled Leadership Memo or Principled Leader Analysis (25%)

3a. Principled Leadership Memo (Individual). Profile your leadership experience and near-
term aspirations. Then, complete three self-assessment surveys, analyze the results, and

formulate at least two realistically promising strategies for increasing your effectiveness as a
Principled Leader. If you are not interested in a formal leadership positions then you may use
this assignment to concentrate on your informal leadership potential (i.e., influencing without
authority or peer leadership). Detailed instructions are available on Canvas.
Length: As a guideline only, approximately 3 pages (single spaced, 1” margins, 12pt font), not
counting a cover page and any tables, figures, or the required appendix of survey results.

3b. Principled Leader Analysis (Individual or group) As an alternative to the above
assignment, conduct a critical analysis of the leadership of an individual that is at least one
rung ahead of you on the career ladder. The analysis should be informed by pertinent course
materials and based on findings from at least two structured interviews. The deliverable will
consist of a profile, a critical analysis, and at least two ideas/strategies for increasing the
leader’s effectiveness. The length and format are the same as the Principled Leadership Memo.
Detailed instructions are available on Canvas.
4. Comparative Ethical Audit—Group 25%
To be completed in teams of 3 or 4 of your choosing. Each member of the team will profile,
critically analyze, and formulate remedial or reinforcing strategies for the ethical performance
of an organization with which s/he is intimately familiar. The team is responsible for reviewing
and finalizing the contributions of each member. The team is also responsible for a brief
comparative analysis, an introduction, and a conclusion. Detailed instructions are available on
Canvas.
Length: As a guideline only, approximately 5 pages for a team of 3 (single spaced, 1” margins,
12pt font), not counting a cover page and any tables, figures, or other graphics. A team of 4
will require an additional page.

General Grading Guidance
Evaluation of written assignments will be based on the content and the professionalism of the
deliverables. Detailed guidance on content is provided in each assignment. Expectations for
professionalism are spelled out in a Writing Tips Memo on Canvas.
Late Work. Requests for reasonable extensions of written assignments will be approved if
received before the assignment is due (per Program mandate, the Comparative Ethical Audit
cannon be extended). That assumes that the assignment can be made up, which may not be
possible for some course requirements. Assignments that are submitted late and without an
approved extension (or emergency) will be penalized 5 points (on a 100 point scale) if <12 hours
late, 10 points for 12-24 hours and 10 points for each day thereafter.</p>
