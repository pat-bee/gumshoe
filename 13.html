<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>MSFLive Judgement Score,15%,MSFLive Attendance Score,10%,Two Mini-Cases,30%,Final Group Project,45% 
Your MSFLive Judgment Score is based on our judgment of your participation. That is, primarily the quality of your answers, comments, and questions. With approximately 25 students in each session, you must make the most of your opportunity to participate. That means being prepared for possible “cold call” questions and listening carefully to the discussion for opportunities to answer a question thrown out to the class, make insightful comments, or ask relevant questions. You should not be concerned if you do not get a chance to participate in every session. This portion of your grade is determined at the end of the course and is based on your overall performance throughout the course.
